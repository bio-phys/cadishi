To (re-)generate the HTML documentation, install the package first in order to
make all the CADISHI modules available be imported by Sphinx.

Then, run the following command on the top-level of the CADISHI source package:

  $ python setup.py build_sphinx

Documentation will be generated in the directory 'doc/html'.
